# VirtualMeetingMonitor

I wrote this project to detech when I am in a Zoom, WebEx or Microsoft Teams meeting in order to automatically turn on and off my on air sign I built.


This is the Arduino code for the on air sign I created that can be controlled via Amazon Echo via a ESP32 microcontroller.
